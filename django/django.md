### **Check Python Version**
Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed. You can check the version by running:
```bash
python --version
````
If do you not have a python installed, use ```winget install Python.Python.3.13``` or latest version. 
Or install in <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Oficial Site.

### :computer: **Create a Virtual Environment**
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. To create one, run:
```bash
python -m venv name_venv
````
then in the directory you can use ```.\name_venv\Scripts\activate``` or ```cd name_venv``` and ```.\Scripts\activate```
### :floppy_disk: **Install Django**
In your venv, use
```pip install django``` -> To install django,

```python -m django startproject projectName``` -> Create django project

```cd projectName``` -> To navigate a django projects directory, 

So uses ```python manage.py createsuperuser``` to create adm credentials.

python manage.py runserver
````

````bash
